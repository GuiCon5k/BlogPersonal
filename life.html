            <h3><span>Hi!</span></h3>
            <p>My name is Guillermo, I don't have a nickname so they just call me Guille :P, I'm from Argentina,
            Buenos Aires, I'm currently 21 years old, raised by beautiful parents with my two younger brothers. <br>
            I went to a normal elementary school and a secondary school with the specialization of Bachelor of Economics.
            So if none of my studies were about programming or anything like that, how did I get here?
            It was just coincidence, a friend started studying this and he told me about it so enthusiastically
            that I wanted to see what it was about, most of my time is always spent on the computer so I figured it
            wouldn't be that complicated, but when I started To see what real programming is, it was as if I had
            discovered a new world.
            Day after day programming and learning new technologies or "tricks" I liked it more and more and the
            hours flew by when I was programming. <br>
            I love programming but... Apart from that I have hobbies that I would love to share with you so you
            can get to know me a little better.</p>

                <p>My oldest hobby and the ones I enjoy the most is playing video games,
                I literally entered this world at the age of 5 when my father bought our first computer,
                my first game was Pinball (In case you didn't know, there is a version for pc)
                since that day I never left this world and a couple of my best friends I met thanks to this world.</p>

                <p>I was always a very athletic and sporty person, I went through many sports for example:
                Tae-Kwon-Do, Soccer, Swimming, Rugby and the list could go on for a long time.
                But there is no sport that has caught me like going to the gym, I started in 2016 and so far 
                I can say that I already maintain it as a way of life.</p>

                it's a very good way for me to disconnect from the world.</p>
